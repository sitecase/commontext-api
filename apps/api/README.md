# API

## express vs nest.js

- nest.js uses esxpress (by default) underneath it which could be changes by fastify when needed for performance gains
- nest.js provides ready to use application architecture structure/abstractions using providers, controllers, modules and services

## NestJs

- what is the difference between middlewares, interceptors and pipes
- 3-layer architecture
- server-sent events (1-way-comm) `@Sse` vs websockets (2-way-comm)
- `@module` grouping entity for 1-to-many controllers and services

## DI

- How TS emits data and how can we leverage it to build DI mechanism
  - `@injectable()` decorator adds TS metadata to the class for framework DI mechanism
  - metata is generated by TS compiler
  - TS provide metada reflection API to do metaprogramming
  - challenges
    - dealing with circular depenndency
    - interfaces -> objects
    - what we know about dependency as a framework so that we can properly inject it ?
  - forward reference
- best of angular for server-backends using nodejs
- class askes for depencies from external sources rather than creating them locallu like

```js
class someService {
  constructor(
    private httpService = new httpService
    private logger = new LoggerService
  ){}
}
```

## Stream oriented architecture

- fancy name over CQRS pattern
  - domain commands, domain queries, domain events happen overtime
  - data comes with unpredictable intervals
  - Advantages / disadvantages
    - complexity, redability, maintainability
  - Reactive programming
- move from Layered Architecture / Service-oriented-architecture to stream-oriented-architecture
- in CQRS we dont have Services anymore they are replaces with commands and queries
